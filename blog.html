               <h2>Pink blush</h2>
               <p>These are baked blushes and they have the smoothest and most silky formula I've tried. Shades 010 has tiny shimmer in it, just like 050 and 060. All three have this healthy glow on the cheeks and it looks amazing. Pigmentation of shade 010 is just like at other great and it applies nicely no matter what brush I use.

               <h2>Masccara</h2>
               <p>Curled lashes make a huge difference - the eye looks bigger and more awake. I'm sure I've complained numerous times about how stubborn my lashes are. Though they are long, they are poker straight, grow criss-cross and years of being smashed behind my glasses have caused a very noticeable sideways split on one eye. All that and my hooded eye shape mean that if I don't curl them well, it looks like I have no eyelashes at all when looking from the front.</p>

                <h2>Body care</h2>
                <p>For a very long time I was not a fan of this. I found it too heavy, creasy because of the overly dewy finish and obvious on the skin - it almost doesn't get worse than that, except it does because their shade Fair is not for us porcelain girls (such an expensive & hyped up product, yet they leave out skin tonesâ€¦). So since it was just sitting in my drawer untouched and it has an SPF 50+, I decided to use it up this summer and the strangest thing happened - it's like it became a completely different foundation. </p>
